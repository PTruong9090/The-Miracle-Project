# The Miracle Project (Hack2Impact)

## Description
The Miracle Project is a nonprofit organization that provides an inclusive theater, film, and expressive arts program that is focused on communicaton, self-esteem, and life skills for neurodivergent and disabled individuals. The nonprofit organization was seeking a website that allowed students to access course materials in the most accesible way since previously, they were using google drive to distribute material, which was extremely difficult for students and parents to navigate. 

Our solution was to create a website where students would be able to access their courses with just the touch of the button. We utilized a speech-to-text api along with Google's Gemini to allow students to navigate to where they want on the site with their voice.
